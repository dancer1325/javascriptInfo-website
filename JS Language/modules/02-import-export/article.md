# Export and Import

* Export and import
  * == directives
  * 👀EXIST SEVERAL syntax 👀 

## `export declarationOfVariableOrFunctionOrClass`

* | class/function, NO need `;` | the end
  * Reason: 🧠 JS style guides 🧠
  * see [function-expressions](../../JS%20Fundamentals/Function%20expressions)
* _Example:_ index.js
  * `nodex index.js`
    * Problems:
      * Problem1: "SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'"
        * Solutions:
          * Solution1: rename to index.mjs & then `nodex index.mjs`
          * Solution2: `npm init -y` & specify `"type":module` & then `node index.js

## Export apart from declarations

```
someDeclaration;
export someDeclaration;
```

* _Example:_ index.js

## Import *

* TODO:
Usually, we put a list of what to import in curly braces `import {...}`, like this:

```js
// 📁 main.js
*!*
import {sayHi, sayBye} from './say.js';
*/!*

sayHi('John'); // Hello, John!
sayBye('John'); // Bye, John!
```

But if there's a lot to import, we can import everything as an object using `import * as <obj>`, for instance:

```js
// 📁 main.js
*!*
import * as say from './say.js';
*/!*

say.sayHi('John');
say.sayBye('John');
```

At first sight, "import everything" seems such a cool thing, short to write, why should we ever explicitly list what we need to import?

Well, there are few reasons.

1. Explicitly listing what to import gives shorter names: `sayHi()` instead of `say.sayHi()`.
2. Explicit list of imports gives better overview of the code structure: what is used and where. It makes code support and refactoring easier.

```smart header="Don't be afraid to import too much"
Modern build tools, such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and others, bundle modules together and optimize them to speedup loading. They also remove unused imports.

For instance, if you `import * as library` from a huge code library, and then use only few methods, then unused ones [will not be included](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/main/examples/harmony-unused#examplejs) into the optimized bundle.
```

## `import something as aliasToGive from ...`

We can also use `as` to import under different names.

For instance, let's import `sayHi` into the local variable `hi` for brevity, and import `sayBye` as `bye`:

```js
// 📁 main.js
*!*
import {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye} from './say.js';
*/!*

hi('John'); // Hello, John!
bye('John'); // Bye, John!
```

## `export someDeclaration as aliasForTheDeclaration`

* _Example:_ index.js & indexTwo.js 

## `export default`

* kinds of modules
  1. Modules / contain a library + pack of functions + ...
  2. Modules / declare 1! entity / export them
     * -> 
       * MANY files
       * 💡use `export default` 💡

* ⚠️1! `export default` / file ⚠️
* NOT necessary to name WHATEVER you export 
* ⚠️ONCE you import it -> use default import == NOT `{}` ⚠️
  * -> 👀named export vs default export 👀

    | Named export | Default export |
    |--------------|----------------|
    | `export class User {...}` | `export default class User {...}` |
    | `import {User} from ...` | `import User from ...`|

* named export & default export | 1! file
  * POSSIBLE
  * 👀NOT recommended 👀

### The "default" name

* allows
  * referring the default export 
    * _Example:_ "referDefaultExport.js"

### A word against default exports

* TODO:
Named exports are explicit. 
They exactly name what they import, so we have that information from them; that's a good thing.

Named exports force us to use exactly the right name to import:

```js
import {User} from './user.js';
// import {MyUser} won't work, the name must be {User}
```

...While for a default export, we always choose the name when importing:

```js
import User from './user.js'; // works
import MyUser from './user.js'; // works too
// could be import Anything... and it'll still work
```

So team members may use different names to import the same thing, and that's not good.

Usually, to avoid that and keep the code consistent, there's a rule that imported variables should correspond to file names, e.g:

```js
import User from './user.js';
import LoginForm from './loginForm.js';
import func from '/path/to/func.js';
...
```

Still, some teams consider it a serious drawback of default exports. So they prefer to always use named exports. Even if only a single thing is exported, it's still exported under a name, without `default`.

That also makes re-export (see below) a little bit easier.

## Re-export

"Re-export" syntax `export ... from ...` allows to import things and immediately export them (possibly under another name), like this:

```js
export {sayHi} from './say.js'; // re-export sayHi

export {default as User} from './user.js'; // re-export default
```

Why would that be needed? Let's see a practical use case.

Imagine, we're writing a "package": a folder with a lot of modules, with some of the functionality exported outside (tools like NPM allow us to publish and distribute such packages, but we don't have to use them), and many modules are just "helpers", for internal use in other package modules.

The file structure could be like this:
```
auth/
    index.js
    user.js
    helpers.js
    tests/
        login.js
    providers/
        github.js
        facebook.js
        ...
```

We'd like to expose the package functionality via a single entry point.

In other words, a person who would like to use our package, should import only from the "main file" `auth/index.js`.

Like this:

```js
import {login, logout} from 'auth/index.js'
```

The "main file", `auth/index.js` exports all the functionality that we'd like to provide in our package.

The idea is that outsiders, other programmers who use our package, should not meddle with its internal structure, search for files inside our package folder. We export only what's necessary in `auth/index.js` and keep the rest hidden from prying eyes.

As the actual exported functionality is scattered among the package, we can import it into `auth/index.js` and export from it:

```js
// 📁 auth/index.js

// import login/logout and immediately export them
import {login, logout} from './helpers.js';
export {login, logout};

// import default as User and export it
import User from './user.js';
export {User};
...
```

Now users of our package can `import {login} from "auth/index.js"`.

The syntax `export ... from ...` is just a shorter notation for such import-export:

```js
// 📁 auth/index.js
// re-export login/logout
export {login, logout} from './helpers.js';

// re-export the default export as User
export {default as User} from './user.js';
...
```

The notable difference of `export ... from` compared to `import/export` is that re-exported modules aren't available in the current file. So inside the above example of `auth/index.js` we can't use re-exported `login/logout` functions.

### Re-exporting the default export

The default export needs separate handling when re-exporting.

Let's say we have `user.js` with the `export default class User` and would like to re-export it:

```js
// 📁 user.js
export default class User {
  // ...
}
```

We can come across two problems with it:

1. `export User from './user.js'` won't work. That would lead to a syntax error.

    To re-export the default export, we have to write `export {default as User}`, as in the example above.

2. `export * from './user.js'` re-exports only named exports, but ignores the default one.

    If we'd like to re-export both named and default exports, then two statements are needed:
    ```js
    export * from './user.js'; // to re-export named exports
    export {default} from './user.js'; // to re-export the default export
    ```

Such oddities of re-exporting a default export are one of the reasons why some developers don't like default exports and prefer named ones.

## Summary

Here are all types of `export` that we covered in this and previous articles.

You can check yourself by reading them and recalling what they mean:

- Before declaration of a class/function/..:
  - `export [default] class/function/variable ...`
- Standalone export:
  - `export {x [as y], ...}`.
- Re-export:
  - `export {x [as y], ...} from "module"`
  - `export * from "module"` (doesn't re-export default).
  - `export {default [as y]} from "module"` (re-export default).

Import:

- Importing named exports:
  - `import {x [as y], ...} from "module"`
- Importing the default export:
  - `import x from "module"`
  - `import {default as x} from "module"`
- Import all:
  - `import * as obj from "module"`
- Import the module (its code runs), but do not assign any of its exports to variables:
  - `import "module"`

We can put `import/export` statements at the top or at the bottom of a script, that doesn't matter.

So, technically this code is fine:
```js
sayHi();

// ...

import {sayHi} from './say.js'; // import at the end of the file
```

In practice imports are usually at the start of the file, but that's only for more convenience.

**Please note that import/export statements don't work if inside `{...}`.**

A conditional import, like this, won't work:
```js
if (something) {
  import {sayHi} from "./say.js"; // Error: import must be at top level
}
```

...But what if we really need to import something conditionally? Or at the right time? Like, load a module upon request, when it's really needed?

We'll see dynamic imports in the next article.
